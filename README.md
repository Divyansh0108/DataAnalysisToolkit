# Comprehensive Data Analysis Toolkit ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the Comprehensive Data Analysis Toolkit! This repository provides an all-in-one solution for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Data Transformation, Model Building, and more. The toolkit is designed to simplify the data analysis process and make it accessible for data enthusiasts, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types with ease.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, select relevant features, and generate polynomial features.
- **Data Transformation**: Apply log transformation, polynomial features, and binning to your data.
- **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models using built-in functions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance with Grid Search.
- **Cross-Validation**: Validate model performance using K-Fold Cross-Validation.
- **Data Sampling**: Split your data into training and testing sets.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate insightful plots using Plotly, including histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts.
- **Download Modified Data**: Easily download cleaned, feature-engineered, transformed, and sampled datasets.

This tool is built with Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface and Plotly for interactive and visually appealing plots.



## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Divyansh0108/DataAnalysisToolkit.git
   cd comprehensive-data-analysis-toolkit
```

2. **Install Dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:**
